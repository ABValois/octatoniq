                        Octatoniq is the personal website of Alex Valois.
                        Rather than getting some boring site like alexvalois.com, I got a short, memorable name that has meaning to me.
                        I use this site to share projects I've worked on &#8211 board games I've made, music I've written, anything else I feel like sharing.

                    <h1>But what does Octatoniq MEAN?</h1><br>
                    <b-card>
                        The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale>Octatonic Scale</a> is a musical device commonly used by some of my favorite composers, including Claude Debussey and Maurice Ravel.
                        The scale's name sounds like it has something to do with the octopus, which happens to be my favorite animal. Peep those tentacles in the Ocattonic logo!
                        Why the "q", you ask? Well... we're all one "q" away from being more unique, aren't we?

                    <b-card> 
                        I got a Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2018, with three majors (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Music Performace) and a certificate in Mathematics.
                        After graduating, I moved back to the Twin Cities, where I grew up, and currently live in Minneapolis.
                        Creating things is a big passion of mine, and I fill my time by thinking about and working on all sorts of creative projects &#8211 very few ever make it to completeion, because my favorite part is designing them.
                        The few that DO end up being completed will end up here, so anyone who wants to can see them.

                    <h1>So what can I do on this site?</h1><br>
                    <b-card>
                        Use the top nav bar to look around a bit. You can check out and order board games I have made, or do the same with music I've written.
                        If you are mosre curious about who I am, try looking over my resume.
                        I even added a section that briefly walks you through how I made this site, so you can check that out if you are curious about making one of your own!
